# Hissteria

A local multi player snake like game. Two players can control one snake each and try to score 100 points.
First player to score 100 points or the last snake standing, whichever comes first, wins the match.
Snakes start with 10 health points each which get decremented by 1 if a snake's head collided with its own body or that of another snake.
